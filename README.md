# NXiE: BETA FRONTEND
###### A frontend for our platform, NXiE. This is a beta version, so it's not finished yet.

Our **Alpha Code**, as it is being built using AI, is not available to the public. However, we are working on a beta version, which is available to the public.
This is the repository for the beta version, where you can get involved with the further development, if you choose to do so. We are not releasing the **Alpha Code** to the public,
as it is an utter mess and so this is the **Clean Version**.

## How to get involved
If you want to get involved, you can do so by forking this repository, and then making a pull request. We will then review your code, and if it's good, we will merge it into the main branch.

## How to run
First you will need to create an account on [**Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com), as we use a two layer authentication system, which requires a **Firebase** account.  
```js
1: Clone the repository repository: git clone https://github.com/NXi3/Beta_Build.git 
2: Run 'firebase login' and login to your account.
3: Run 'firebase init' and select the 'Options' you want, we would recommend them all.
4: Run 'firebase deploy' and wait for it to deploy.
4: Run 'npm start:dev' and wait for it to start.
```

You are also going to need the [Backend Api](), if you intend on using this frontend with its full capabilities.
