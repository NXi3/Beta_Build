# NXiE: BETA FRONTEND
###### A frontend for our platform, NXiE. This is a beta version, so it's not finished yet.

Our **Alpha Code**, as it is being built using AI, is not available to the public. However, we are working on a beta version, which is available to the public.
This is the repository for the beta version, where you can get involved with the further development, if you choose to do so. We are not releasing the **Alpha Code** to the public,
as it is an utter mess and so this is the **Clean Version**.

## How to get involved
If you want to get involved, you can do so by forking this repository, and then making a pull request. We will then review your code, and if it's good, we will merge it into the main branch.

## How to run
First you will need to create an account on [**Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com), as we use a two layer authentication system, which requires a **Firebase** account.
You will also need the **Firebase CLI** installed, which you can do by running `npm install -g firebase-tools` in your terminal. Then, you will need to run `firebase login` in your terminal, 
and login to your **Firebase** account. You will then need to run `firebase init` in your terminal, and select the **Firebase** project you want to use. Then, you will need to run `firebase deploy` in your terminal,
to deploy the frontend to Firebase for storage.

You are also going to need the [Backend Api](), if you intend on using this frontend with its full capabilities.
